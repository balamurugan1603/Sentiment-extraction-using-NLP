# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
# Motivation
Hate speech is an unfortunately common occurrence on the Internet. Often social media sites like Facebook and Twitter face the problem of identifying and censoring problematic posts while weighing the right to freedom of speech. The importance of detecting and moderating hate speech is evident from the strong connection between hate speech and actual hate crimes. Early identification of users promoting hate speech could enable outreach programs that attempt to prevent an escalation from speech to action. Sites such as Twitter and Facebook have been seeking to actively combat hate speech. In spite of these reasons, NLP research on hate speech has been very limited, primarily due to the lack of a general definition of hate speech, an analysis of its demographic influences, and an investigation of the most effective features.

# Data
train.csv - Labelled dataset of 31,962 tweets. Csv file with each line storing a tweet id, its label and the tweet.<br>
test.csv - The test data file contains only tweet ids and the tweet text with each tweet in a new line.

# Approach
I have approached the problem using different models which uses various vector space representations such as Bag-of-words, Tf-Idf, Embeddings after analysing the text data deeply using various EDA techniques.
